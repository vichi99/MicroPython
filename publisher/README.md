# Description

- Main script publishing by wifi measured data from `Nodemcu` via MicroPython to mqtt broker.
- After successfully connect to wifi is setted rtc time by ntp.
- Measured data are temperature and humidity by using `DHT22` sensor.
- Interval sending measured can be synchronize on zero seconds by minutes or interval is setted by second and sending is ASAP.
- Script operate with my [utils classes](https://github.com/vichi99/ESP8266/tree/master/utils) `mqtt` and `wifi`.

# Installation

- Connecting with device and deploying scripts is described [here.](https://github.com/vichi99/ESP8266/blob/master/Deploy_MicroPython_scripts.md)

- For this application we need load this files to device. Utils are available [here.](https://github.com/vichi99/ESP8266/tree/master/utils)

- Make config file.

- Copy these files to nodemcu:

```sh
boot.py
main.py
config.json
mqtt.py # from utils
wifi.py # from utils
```

# Usage

- Before runing scripts is important make `config.json` from `config.json.example` and fill it.

```python
# will sended in data
"NAME_DEVICE": "Device_1",
"POSITION": "Room 1",

# MEASURED device - DHT22
"DHT22_PIN": 14

# Timezone
"GMT": 2

############## SEND DATA INTERVAL #########################
# 1. Set true if you will wait to synchronize on whole minute with zero seconds etc. (12:02:00).
# If false meas will start immediately.
"SYNC_SEND_DATA": True # in json file with lower case `true`

# 2. Setted interval(int) sending data.
"INTERVAL_SEND_DATA": 60

"WIFI_SSID": ""
"WIFI_PASSWORD": ""
"DEV_TOPIC": "pokoj/device_1/data"
"MQTT_IP": ""
"MQTT_USER": "" # optional
"MQTT_PASS": "" # optional
############# DATA FORMAT
# data = {
#             "name": CONFIG["NAME_DEVICE"],
#             "position": CONFIG["POSITION"],
#             "date": local_time,
#             "temperature": float,
#             "humidity": float
#         }

```
